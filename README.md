## DeepILS: Towards Accurate Domain Invariant AIoT-enabled Inertial Localization System

This is the Pytorch implementation

A novel Neural Network called DeepILS is proposed for AIoT enabled Inertial Positioning to use IMU data and performs pedestrian inertial navigation. 


# Architectures
DeepILS with other ResNet18-based model architectures are presented for comparative analysis. IMUNet, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MnasNet, and EfficientNetB0 models have been re-implemented to work with one-dimensional Inertial data.

# Dataset
1. DeepILS is evaluated on six inertial odometry datssets.
